This project aims to reimplement well-known but not further mentioned transport-simulations.
If you are keen on providing conceptional, artistic, programmatic and / or testing work - and we surely could use a lot of collaboration - please feel free to contribute or contact me.

## The goal
The goal is to release a fully-fletched 3D-game **without** a campaign, utilizing the Amazon Lumberyard 3D-Engine, letting the player create, manage and view distribution networks between a number of deliverers and consumers.
